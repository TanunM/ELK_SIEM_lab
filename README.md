# ELK_SIEM_lab

## Introduction
This SOC Lab Challenge is designed to simulate real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) activities. The goal is to strengthen my hands-on skills in monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Over four weeks, Iâ€™ll build a complete SOC environment by configuring SIEM tools, analyzing attacks, and managing incidents to better understand how SOC teams operate in real scenarios.

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to broaden my practical knowledge of SOC through step-by-step labs that cover:
* Setting up and using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis.
* Detecting and investigating brute-force attacks, malware infections, and C2 traffic.
* Creating dashboards, alerts, and automated responses.
* Managing incidents using a ticketing system to simulate SOC workflows.
By completing this challenge, I aim to build real-world SOC experience, strengthen my analytical skills, and demonstrate readiness for an entry-level SOC analyst role.
